# WordChainsTask
A program that finds the shortest *chain* between two input words. 
Every element of the chain may differ from previous and next ones only with one letter. 
Every element must be a word from a dictionary.
All elements must be the same length (same goes for the input words).

A project was created using TTD. For any of the example inputs the program shouldn't take more than 1 sec to solve them.

#### Examples

##### For input: cat, dog
```
[cat, cot, cog, dog]
```

##### For input: lead, gold
```
[lead, load, goad, gold]
```

##### For input: ruby, code
```
[ruby, rube, robe, rode, code]
```
